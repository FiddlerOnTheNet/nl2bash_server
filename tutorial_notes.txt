migrate
    Applies migrations to your database

makemigrations
    Updates any migrations that have changed and creates new ones.
    Migration scripts basically keep your models that you write with
    Django synced with the structure of the database you are using.
    Django uses an Object-relational-mapper (ORM), which just means
    that things defined in Django models can be linked to components
    of the database structure, so that you can easily refer to the
    database in your code. This is done through migrations, which
    Django updates whenever you use makemigrations when you make a
    change to your models.

development web server
    This is the light-weight web server you can use to test your
    website. It is not robust enough and has too poor performance
    to be used in production, but it is good for testing. By default,
    it "serves the site" to localhost:8000, AKA http://127.0.0.1:8000

runserver
    Start the development server
