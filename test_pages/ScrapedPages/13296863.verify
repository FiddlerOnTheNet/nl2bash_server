{"title":"Difference between wait and sleep","commands":[null,"wait [n ...]\n        Wait  for each specified process and return its termination sta-\n        tus.  Each n may be a process ID or a job  specification;  if  a\n        job  spec  is  given,  all  processes in that job\u0027s pipeline are\n        waited for.  If n is not given, all currently active child  pro-\n        cesses  are  waited  for,  and  the return status is zero.  If n\n        specifies a non-existent process or job, the  return  status  is\n        127.   Otherwise,  the  return  status is the exit status of the\n        last process or job waited for. \u0026\u0026 SYNOPSIS\n        sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]...\n\n    DESCRIPTION\n        Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be ‘s’ for seconds (the default),\n        ‘m’ for minutes, ‘h’ for hours or ‘d’ for days.  Unlike most  implemen-\n        tations  that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER may be an arbi-\n        trary floating point number.  Given two or more  arguments,  pause  for\n        the amount of time specified by the sum of their values. \u0026\u0026 ","workhard \u0026\n[1] 27408\nworkharder \u0026\n[2] 27409\nwait %1 %2 \u0026\u0026 ","wait%1 or wait $PID\nwait ${!} \u0026\u0026 sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]\nsleep 5 (sleep five seconds) \u0026\u0026 ","sleep 10 \u0026\nwait %1 \u0026\u0026 "]}
