What's a concise way to check that environment variables are set in a Unix shell script?
: ${STATE?"Need to set STATE"}
: ${DEST:?"Need to set DEST non-empty"}
: "${STATE?Need to set STATE}"
: "${DEST:?Need to set DEST non-empty}"
${parameter:?word}
In script.sh line 13:
: ${FOO:?"The environment variable 'FOO' must be set and non-empty"}
  ^-- SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting.
: "${STATE?Need to set STATE}"
: "${DEST:?Need to set DEST non-empty}"
$ mkdir junk
$ cd junk
$ > abc
$ > def
$ > ghi
$ 
$ x="*"
$ printf "%s\n" ${x:?You must set x}    # Careless; not recommended
abc
def
ghi
$ unset x
$ printf "%s\n" ${x:?You must set x}    # Careless; not recommended
bash: x: You must set x
$ printf "%s\n" "${x:?You must set x}"  # Careful: should be used
bash: x: You must set x
$ x="*"
$ printf "%s\n" "${x:?You must set x}"  # Careful: should be used
*
$ printf "%s\n" ${x:?"You must set x"}  # Not quite careful enough

ghi
$ x=
$ printf "%s\n" ${x:?"You must set x"}  # Not quite careful enough
bash: x: You must set x
$ unset x
$ printf "%s\n" ${x:?"You must set x"}  # Not quite careful enough
bash: x: You must set x
